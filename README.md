# auth-api



Description
In this final phase, the new requirement is to extend the restrictive capabilities of our routes to our API, implementing a fully functional, authenticated and authorized API Server using the latest coding techniques

Specifically, we want to make the following restrictions:

Regular users can READ
Writers can READ and CREATE
Editors can READ, CREATE, and UPDATE
Administrators can READ, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE
